# Oil-Spills-Analysis-and-Solution

## Problem


Oil Spills leading to increase in pollution as well as increase in fuel prices.

## Solution


For the first problem where we have to minimize the total repair time we got the below solution - 
With the given constraints and the objective function we got our OPTIMUM SOLUTION as 14361.53 (Total Repair Time). 
Our OPTIMUM VALUE as 2 crews for Simsbury, 5 for Fairfield and 3 for Windsor.


For the second problem where we have to minimize the maximum repair time we got the below solution - 
With the given constraints and the objective function we got our OPTIMUM SOLUTION as 5288.62 (Minimum of Maximum Repair Time). 
Our OPTIMUM VALUE as 1 crew for Simsbury, 6 for Fairfield and 3 for Windsor.
